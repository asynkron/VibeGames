Pac-Man CRT (temp)

How to run
- Open index.html directly in your browser, or serve the folder via any static server.
- Controls: Arrow keys to move Pac-Man. Eat all pellets to win. Power pellets frighten ghosts temporarily.

Whatâ€™s included
- Self-contained HTML/JS/CSS. No external dependencies.
- CRT effects: scanlines, vignette, glow, subtle flicker.

Notes
- Ghosts use simplified AI (intersection choices with a bias toward the player; frightened mode on power pellets). Starts in the house and exits after a short delay.
- Designed for readability and extension if you want to add authentic scatter/chase timings, fruit bonuses, or sounds.

# Neon Outrun

A faux-3D highway sprint inspired by Out Run: the game draws perspective-scaled road slices, alternating grass shoulders, and billboard sprites for a synthwave skyline.

## Controls

- **Up / W** – accelerate
- **Down / S** – brake or reverse
- **Left / Right / A / D** – steer
- **Shift** – hold for a short turbo burst

## Local development

Serve the folder with any static server, for example:

```bash
npx serve outrun
```

Then open the reported `http://localhost` address in your browser and enjoy the neon sunset.

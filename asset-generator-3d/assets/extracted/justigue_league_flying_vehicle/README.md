# Justigue League Flying Vehicle – Extracted Components

These OBJ files were separated from the original `justigue league flying vehicle.obj` asset so that individual spaceship building blocks can be mixed and matched.

- `justigue_league_flying_vehicle__main_hull.obj` – The textured fuselage, wings, and engine block (DAZ export object `justice1`) that carries the bulk of the geometry. Uses the `default` material with the `Maps/zqw1b.jpg` diffuse texture.
- `justigue_league_flying_vehicle__yellow_trim.obj` – Slim yellow accent rails (`justice__2`) that wrap around the hull using the solid-color `material_1` material.
- `justigue_league_flying_vehicle__white_wings.obj` – White structural wing panels (`justice_3`) that can be layered over the hull for extra shape.
- `justigue_league_flying_vehicle__cyan_highlights.obj` – Small cyan highlight caps (`justice_4`) that work well as canopy lights or engine glows.

The accompanying `justigue_league_flying_vehicle.mtl` file and `Maps/` texture directory are copied alongside these components so each part can render independently.

# Federation Interceptor HN48 – Extracted Components

This directory contains individual building blocks derived from the original **Federation Interceptor HN48 landed** OBJ model. Each file retains the original material bindings so that textures from `Maps/` continue to work out of the box.

## Available components

- `federation_interceptor_hn48_landed__body3.obj` – the main fuselage and wings (`o body3`).
- `federation_interceptor_hn48_landed__ship_landing_gear.obj` – the full landing gear assembly (`o ship landing gear`).
- `federation_interceptor_hn48_landed__landing_gear_doors.obj` – segmented doors that enclose the landing gear (`o landing gear doors`).
- `federation_interceptor_hn48_landed__ship_door.obj` – the side access door for the spacecraft (`o ship door`).

All components share the copied material definition `Federation_Interceptor_HN48_landed.mtl` and the texture set inside the `Maps/` directory.

The source OBJ file was removed after extraction, leaving these modular assets ready for kit-bashing new ships.
